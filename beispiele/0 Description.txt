Technical Description
The disclosed UI implements a multi-tenant project management interface featuring:
1. System Definition Interface - A dual-panel layout presenting in-scope systems alongside an interactive form for adding new systems with configurable attributes.
2. History Analysis Module - A unified dashboard that combines installation readiness and perfromance measure. Shows pre-install checks and dependency validation, provisioning and IMP installation timelines (including IMP views creation), notification log to Basis Admin, and estimated time-to-readiness. After readiness, displays real-time throughput metrics (Mbit/s) by data category, per-system progress, export time estimates with trend history and more System Details.
3. Deployment Configuration Interface - An editable table allowing storage size verification and adjustment per system component prior to deployment initiation, with visual progress indication during system preparation.
4. Phase-Based Implementation Workflow - A hierarchical, expandable phase structure supporting multiple content migration types. Each phase contains sequential steps: Data Transfer, Content Creation, Manager Handover, and User Acceptance Testing.
5. Transfer Monitoring Interface - Real-time transfer status visualization with success/error/pending counters, searchable data tables with status badges, and completeness report generation.
6. Content Creation Trigger - A single-action control that initiates content creation. On click, the UI starts a progress indicator and dispatches a backend signal to IMP.
7. Handover Workflow - Formalized submission mechanism enabling phase completion handoff to designated managers with audit trail preservation.
The interface enforces stage-gate progression, preventing advancement until prerequisite steps achieve completion status, ensuring process compliance and auditability.
